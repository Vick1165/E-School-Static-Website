            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.

                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.Although there are private schools in
                India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be
                a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence,
                the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading.[17]

                In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.[18] In India's higher education
                system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In
                universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a
                maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary.
                Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Transformative learning, as a theory, says that the process of
                "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self),
                convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).

                Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. Jack Mezirow
                believes that it usually results from a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a life crisis or
                major life transitionâ€”although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning
                schemes over a period of time.[3] Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher, also
                promote transformation.
                Jack Mezirow developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978.[7] Since then, the theory has
                evolved "into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and
                reformulate the meaning of their experience."[8] For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific
                beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), "they must engage in critical reflection on their
                experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation."[9] The meaning schemes that make up
                meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme
                and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning
